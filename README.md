Welcome, dear traveler, to the Briggs-Meyer Personality Test! This project invites you to discover your personality type through a blend of thoughtful questions and AI-powered analysis.

## âœ¨ What Is This Project?
The Briggs-Meyer Personality Test helps you uncover your personality type (like INFP or ESTJ) based on your answers to a series of questionsâ€”both numerical and written. The frontend, a React app hosted on Vercel with a Node.js backend on Render, using the Gemini API to analyze your written responses and break ties in your personality traits.
